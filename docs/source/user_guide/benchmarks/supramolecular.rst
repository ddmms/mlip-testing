PLA15

Summary
-------

Performance in predicting protein–ligand active-site interaction energies for the
PLA15 set of 15 complexes. Systems range from 259 to 584 atoms and contain complete
active sites. Ligands contain 37–95 atoms with net charges of −1, 0, or +1 and all contain
aromatic heterocycles. Five ligands contain either divalent of tetrahedral sulfur atoms, and
four and three of them contain F and Cl atoms, respectively.
