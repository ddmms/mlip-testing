Summary
-------

Performance in predicting host-guest interaction energies for 16 large non-covalent
complexes. These include proteins, DNA, and supramolecular assemblies ranging from 380
up to 1988 atoms with diverse interaction motives. 14 complexes are neurtral, and two are
charged with charges +1 (TYK2) and -2 (FXa).

Metrics
-------

Interaction energy error (all complexes)

For each complex, the interaction energy is calculated by taking the difference in energy
between the host-guest complex and the sum of the individual host and guest energies. This is
compared to the reference interaction energy, calculated in the same way.

Interaction energy error (charged complexes)

For each charged complex, the interaction energy is calculated by taking the difference in energy
between the host-guest complex and the sum of the individual host and guest energies. This is
compared to the reference interaction energy, calculated in the same way.

Interaction energy error (neutral complexes)

For each neutral complex, the interaction energy is calculated by taking the difference in energy
between the host-guest complex and the sum of the individual host and guest energies. This is
compared to the reference interaction energy, calculated in the same way.

Computational cost
------------------

low: tests are likely to take minutes to run on CPU.
